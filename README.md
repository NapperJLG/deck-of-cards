## Tech Stack

- React
- Typescript
- Sass
- Styled Components
- Firebase

## Features

- Displays a full deck in ascending suit order (clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades)
- The `Shuffle` button will randomly sort the order of the deck. It will also return any cards that have been drawn to the deck
- The `Draw Card` button will take the top card from the deck and add it to the user's "hand" underneath the buttons.
- The `Sort Hand` button will arrange the drawn cards into ascending suit order.

## Potential Improvements
- Make the cards look nicer e.g display the correct number of pips, have pictures for the face cards
- Make the page responsive
- Add more sort functionality e.g sort by ascending or descending values regardless of suit - use a dropdown instead of a button
